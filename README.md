# Arcanot
A quick and simple card game using tarot cards designed to be used in roleplaying game settings.

## Introduction
Arcanot (pronounced Ark-arn-oh) is a short, simple and replayable game designed to be used in roleplaying games as an in-universe game characters can play, that is quick to teach and will not take up too much of the valuable roleplaying time!
It is designed to play with a standard 78 card tarot deck with:
- 22 Major Arcana cards (numbered 0-21)
- 4 Suits (Wands, Swords, Pentacles, Cups) containing:
  - Ace
  - Numbers 2-10
  - 4 face cards (Page, Knight, Queen, King)

## How to Play
1. The deck of tarot cards is shuffled.
2. Each player draws a hand of 5 cards.
3. Each player places 3 of their 5 cards face down in front of them. The remaining cards are discarded.
4. Players determine who will move first (e.g. by coin flip).
5. This player then reveals 1 of their face down cards.
6. The opposing player reveals one of their face down cards to challenge it.
7. The player who used the card with the highest number wins the round, with the following exceptions: 
   - Aces are worth 11
   - Pages, Knights, Queens and Kings are worth 10
   - Certain suits trump other suits, regardless of the number played:
      - Wands beat Swords
      - Swords beat Pentacles
      - Pentacles beat Cups
      - Cups beat Wands
   - If two Major Arcana cards are played, the lowest number wins.
      - Major Arcana cards are the named cards which do not belong in the 4 suits (e.g. The Fool, Death, The World)
8. Repeat 4-6 until all face down cards have been used.
   - The winner of a previous round reveals first in the next round.
   - If the previous round was drawn, the player who revealed last now reveals first.
   - If both players have only one card left, both reveal simultaneously.
9. The player who won the most rounds wins the game!
